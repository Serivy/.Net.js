# CLR.js
CLR.js provides a java script implementation of the .Net CLR (Or Execution Engine). It has a module which mimics mscoree.dll and long term goal to implement a java script version of mscorlib.dll to reduce the file size.

## Vision
The goal of this project is to allow simple .net dlls to be written, compiled and then executed from Javascript so that logic can be shared between platforms better.
