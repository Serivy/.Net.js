# .Net.js
.Net.js provides a javascript implementation of the CLR (Or Execution Engine). It has a module which does the job of mscoree.dll and plans to implement a java version of mscorlib.dll to reduce the file size. The goal is to allow simple .net dlls to be written, compiled and then executed from Javascript so that logic can be shared between platforms better.
